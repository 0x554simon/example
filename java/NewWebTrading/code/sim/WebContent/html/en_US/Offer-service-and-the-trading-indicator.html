Unmatched At-auction Limit Orders will be converted into Limit Orders and carried forward to the Continuous Trading Session provided that the specified price of that order does not deviate 9 times or more from the nominal price. IEP is the price with maximum number of orders matched in the Order Matching Period. Indicative Equilibrium Volume (IEV) is the transaction volume done in IEP. Those figures can be referred in the RTQ Applet.

            What is Conditional Order? 
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                 Investors may wish to place a buy/sell order when the price of a certain stock goes above or below a certain level. In this case, you can choose to use "Conditional Order": When the stock nominal price reaches the Trigger Price of your "Conditional Order" you preset, "Power Securities" or "Online Securities" will send out a Limit Order with your pre Order Price predefined to market for matching or queuing. We have provided two types of "Conditional Order". They are classified as "Conditional Order - Up Trigger" and "Conditional Order - Down Trigger". 
            </p>
        </div>
        <h2 class="question">
             How long are the Conditional Orders valid for? 

</h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>All "Conditional Orders" are Day Orders. They are valid until the end of the trading day for which they were placed and canceled by the end of that day if not executed. "Conditional Orders" can be triggered and executed in Pre-opening session (09:00 – 09:20) according to the Indicative Equilibrium Price (IEP). In addition, Conditional Orders are also applicable during "Good Till Next Day" order session. Others placed during this period will be saved until the next trading morning to be executed and valid until market close of that trading day. Please refer to "Definition and Operation of Good Till Next Trading Day" for more detail.

            <p>The reason to follow the 15/2 rules of the conditional order instead of the prevailing 24/4 rules is to prevent the triggered order being rejected when it is too far away from the nominal price. </p>
            <p>
                Example : Suppose the Trigger Price is set to be $60, and the client has entered a Conditional Order. Please refer the following table about the result of using 15/2 rules and 24/4 rules in placing an Condition Order.

        <h2 class="question">
            Conditional Orders are valid on which trading platforms？ </h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>Conditional Order is only valid in "Online Securities Trading" and "PowerSecurities". You cannot place the order through other online channels (e.g. Mobile Trading, 3G, IVRS and Mango Combo), however you can still amend or cancel the Order Price and Quantity of Conditional Order (except Mango Combo) 
            </p>

        <h2 class="question">
             Is Conditional Order equal to a Stop Loss or Stop Gain Order? 
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                 Condition Order is neither a Stop Loss nor Stop Gain Order. For Condition Order, when the Nominal Price reaches the Trigger Price, the system will send the Limit Order to the market automatically for execution. Unlike the Futures Market, there is a lot more stocks in Securities Market and no restriction on Order Price, the Limit Order sent to the market maynot be filled due to the liquidity issue. Therefore, Conditional Order maynot able to achieve the purpose of Stop Gain/Loss even it is triggered as the order cannot be matched in the market.

        <h2 class="question">
             Will the orders be rejected or fail to be performed? 
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
 There is a possibility that the order may not be performed even if the price of the respective stock has hit the specified triggered level due to fluctuation in stock price, system failure and any event beyond the control of Haitong International. Even the Comditional Order is triggered, the order maybe rejected by HKEX if the stock price is too volatile.

        <h2 class="question">
            Can I amend my orders? 
        </h2>
        <div class="answer">
            <p>
                 The system will check against the condition of the Conditional Order at 7 a.m. in the trading day. Once it is triggered, the Trigger Price cannot be amended again. (If it is triggered from 7 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., the Conditional Order will still be in "Received" Status, else if it is triggered from 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., the Conditional Order will be in "Queuing" Status)

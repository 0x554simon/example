Hibernate Tools Changelog
=========================

Changes in version 2.1.3
------------------------

* Made getComponents() non static to allow multiple threads/calls to hbm2java
* Fixed hbm2java to not invoke hbm2java per file, but on complete fileset instead
* Updated .bat files to report about missing HIBERNATE_HOME and (hopefull) be more tolerant (HB-391)

Changes in version 2.1.2
------------------------

* now prints warning and ignores extra "use-in-equals" for hashcode and equals in subclass since it will break the equals() contract (HB-899).
* fixed bug that made equals() always return true (HB-900)
* fixed bug that prevented hbm2java to start without --config option (HB-887)

Changes in version 2.1.1
------------------------

* added support for generating empty concrete class for a Base class.
* added support for <parent> in <composite-element>
* added meta class-code, extra-import attributes
* hbm2java no longer generates automatically an equals()/hashcode() set unless the class has a composite id or the class is a composite.
  - use meta implement-equals attribute to enable generating equals()/hashcode() + mark relevant properties with meta use-in-equals attribute.
* added meta use-in-equals attribute.

Changes in version 2.1
----------------------

* hbm2java now validates the hbm.xml files
* hbm2java now have an Velocity based renderer
* Renderer's can now be configured with <param> tags
* Refactored the "source model" hbm2java uses. 
  + now all elements have access to their corresponding XML data. Can be used to access all the information that are not otherwise directly available.

Changes in version 2.0.1
------------------------

* hbm2java now supports the defining subclass and joined-subclass externally from it's superclass (e.g. in another hbm.xml file)
* Fixed bug in deciding if POJO needed a minimalconstructor ;)
* Added support for CompositeUserType
* bounded and constraint changeevents is now correctly sending old and new values. (Shane Day, HB-275)
* now uses "finder-method" instead of just "finder" for finder generation.
* bag's are now generated as java.util.List instead of more generic Collections.
 If you want the old behavior back then set system property "hbm2java.bag.interface" to
 java.util.Collection (or whatever other class/interface you want for bag ;)
* hbm2java only generate isX() for primitive boolean types.
